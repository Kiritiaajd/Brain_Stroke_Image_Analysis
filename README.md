## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pip or Conda for package management

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kiritiaajd/Brain_Stroke_Image_Analysis.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. If you encounter dependency issues (e.g., `torch` and `torchvision`), ensure compatible versions are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install torch==2.2.0 torchvision==0.17.0
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Project
To start the training or evaluation process, run:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Dataset Preparation
Ensure your dataset is organized as follows:
```
data/
├── train/
├── test/
└── validation/
```

Update the dataset path in the `config.yaml` or relevant file in the repository.

### Testing the Model
To evaluate the model's performance:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/saved/model.pth
```
